# tiny-api-k8s
k8s config files for the tiny-api project

Will be used with k8s 🚢 and argocd setup 🦑.

### TODOs:
 1. add and setup this repo
 2. add CI to [tiny-api](https://github.com/2beens/tiny-api) project, to:
    - build and push the docker image with new version/tag on each merge to master
    - edit this repo here, to update the config files with new docker image version
    - watch ArgoCD do it's thing 😍
